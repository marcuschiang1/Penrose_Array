Project dependency resolution and build tool for JS (I can't think of a good name)


Project Structure and Usage
---------------------------

TODO Document the following

* stuff that must be in package.json for this to work
* defining dependencies
* where build artifacts are assumed to be
* assumptions about npm install triggering the build
* other assumptions about project structure
* defining custom build templates

TODO
----

* DONE roger bin to expose common tasks
* Add a "verbose" mode to the roger bin
* performance
** refactor cache object
** consider caching the dependency graph and project configs?
* API
** REVIEW Project exposes too much that isn't safe to call except at the top level
* Code Quality
** Remove dead code/interfaces
* DONE Windows Support
* Git Compatibility
** Support tags as well as branches
** support tags instead of just branches
* unit tests
* development mode
** pull down all the dependencies and build them without building the top-level project
** create a 'project is actively developed' flag, if it's enabled always checkout develop for that project
* grunt tasks for everything that bin/roger exposes
* Docs
* Boogs!
** Verify that the update stuff actually picks up new changes correctly

JavaScript is expected to adhere to the [OpenTok style guide][osg]. It is recommended
you use JSHint with the options set in the `jshintConfig` key of `package.json`.
