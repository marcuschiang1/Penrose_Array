This repo contains a python script that generates diagrams of arrays in Penrose.
The demo shows how to use it and contains examples with a stack and binary search. 

Within the repository, you can use the roger trio command line interface to generate an svg with the Python-generated substance file.
The command will take a domain file, a style file, a substance file, and pipe the output to a svg file.
It would look something like: roger trio domain/array.domain style/penrose_stack.style substance/stack.substance > images/stack.svg
